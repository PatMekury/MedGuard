## **ANTICIPATED Q&A RESPONSES**

**Q: Data latency?**  
A: Weekly Copernicus updates, monthly FAO. Automated pipeline with clear timestamps.

**Q: Accuracy validation?**  
A: All sources authoritative (EU/UN/IUCN). QC checks during processing.

**Q: Scalability?**  
A: Architecture is global-ready. Mediterranean first due to highest crisis.

**Q: Primary customers?**  
A: (1) National agencies, (2) Aquaculture firms, (3) Conservation NGOs.

**Q: vs. competitors?**  
A: Traditional tools = single-species, report-based. We = ecosystem, real-time, multi-stakeholder.

**Q: Success metrics?**  
A: (1) Overfishing reduction in MedGuard zones, (2) MPA coverage increase, (3) User adoption.

**Q: EDITO integration?**  
A: Cloud computing, data lake access, workflow managers. Built for EDITO ecosystem.
