## **SLIDE-BY-SLIDE SCRIPT**

### **SLIDE 1: Title Slide (20 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Good [morning/afternoon], judges. I'm presenting MedGuard—a platform that's transforming Mediterranean fisheries management from reactive crisis response to proactive ecosystem protection. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how we're addressing one of Europe's most critical environmental challenges."

**Timing:** 0:00 - 0:20

---

### **SLIDE 2: The Hook (30 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Here's the crisis: 96% of Mediterranean fish stocks are overfished—the highest rate in the world. Traditional single-species management has failed. We're losing not just fish, but entire ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The Mediterranean needs a new approach, and that's exactly what MedGuard delivers."

**Tone:** Urgent, passionate, data-driven

**Timing:** 0:20 - 0:50

---

### **SLIDE 3: The Problem (35 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Why are current systems failing? Four critical gaps: First, data is fragmented—fishing data lives separately from environmental data and protected areas. Second, there's no spatial context—managers can't see WHERE problems emerge. Third, management is reactive—decisions happen after stocks collapse. And fourth, stakeholders work in opposition rather than collaboration. Fish farmers, fishermen, and conservationists all need different things, but no platform serves them all."

**Pace:** Moderate, emphasize each point clearly

**Timing:** 0:50 - 1:25

---

### **SLIDE 4: The Solution (40 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "MedGuard integrates everything into one decision-support platform. We provide real-time overfishing risk maps by combining fishing pressure with ecosystem health. We identify critical spawning and nursery grounds. We analyze connectivity—how marine populations flow across the sea. We integrate Marine Protected Areas to show coverage gaps. And most importantly, we deliver actionable insights tailored to each stakeholder—whether you're a fish farmer selecting sites, a policy maker designing regulations, or a conservationist planning protection networks."

**Tone:** Confident, solutions-focused

**Timing:** 1:25 - 2:05

---

### **SLIDE 5: Innovation & Value (30 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "What makes MedGuard different? We're the first ecosystem-based management platform specifically for the Mediterranean. We integrate three authoritative data sources that previously existed in silos. Unlike static reports, we provide real-time spatial analysis. And here's the key: we serve ALL stakeholders with clear business value. Fish farmers get site selection intelligence for higher yields. Fishers get sustainable harvest zones. Conservationists get data-driven MPA optimization. Governments get evidence for credible policy."

**Tone:** Enthusiastic, emphasize uniqueness

**Timing:** 2:05 - 2:35

---

### **SLIDE 6: Data Sources (30 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Our data foundation is rock-solid. From Copernicus Marine Service, we pull ocean temperature, chlorophyll, salinity, and currents for ecosystem health monitoring. From FAO Global Fishing Watch, we get Mediterranean fishing effort by country and area for pressure assessment. From Protected Planet, we have all MPA boundaries for network analysis. And we've built this on EDITO Model Lab infrastructure—using their cloud computing and data lake to process terabytes of information."

**Tone:** Technical but accessible

**Timing:** 2:35 - 3:05

---

### **SLIDE 7: Hackathon Journey (30 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Let me walk you through our progress. Pre-event, we identified the crisis and designed our framework. Days 1-2, we built the data pipeline—downloading 50 gigabytes from Copernicus, integrating FAO statistics, and processing MPA boundaries. Days 3-4, we developed the dashboard—creating four analysis layers with temporal controls. Day 5, we refined everything—professional UI, performance optimization, and stakeholder-specific insights. This wasn't just code—it was a complete ecosystem management system in five days."

**Tone:** Proud but humble, emphasize speed of progress

**Timing:** 3:05 - 3:35

---

### **SLIDE 8: Live Demo (45 seconds)**

**ACTIONS:**
1. Switch to live dashboard in browser
2. Show Mediterranean overview map
3. Toggle between Risk, Habitat, Connectivity layers
4. Demonstrate date filtering
5. Highlight MPA overlays
6. Show one stakeholder insight panel

**Say:**
> "Now let me show you the platform live. [DEMO DASHBOARD] Here's the Mediterranean with overfishing risk displayed spatially. Notice how we can toggle between analysis types—risk, habitat quality, connectivity. We can filter by date to see temporal changes. These blue boundaries are Marine Protected Areas—you can instantly see coverage gaps. And here's the key: for every layer, we provide stakeholder-specific insights. This tells fish farmers exactly what the data means for their site selection decisions."

**Timing:** 3:35 - 4:20

---

### **SLIDE 9: Business Model (25 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "MedGuard is sustainable long-term. We're using a freemium model with basic access free and advanced features paid. Government licenses for national agencies. Commercial subscriptions for fish farms and consulting firms. And API access for system integration. Our impact goals: 20% reduction in overfishing pressure by 2027, double effective MPA coverage, and support 50,000 fishers with sustainable zone data."

**Tone:** Business-focused, realistic

**Timing:** 4:20 - 4:45

---

### **SLIDE 10: Team (10 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "Our multidisciplinary team brings marine biology, data science, full-stack development, and policy expertise. In this hackathon alone, we integrated three major data sources, built a production-ready dashboard, and validated our approach with fisheries experts."

**Timing:** 4:45 - 4:55

---

### **SLIDE 11: Call to Action (5 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "The Mediterranean needs MedGuard. Join us in transforming fisheries management. Thank you—I'm ready for questions."

**Tone:** Powerful, confident close

**Timing:** 4:55 - 5:00

---

## **Q&A PREPARATION (3 minutes)**

### **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

#### **Technical Questions:**

**Q: "How do you handle data latency and updates?"**
**A:** "Copernicus data updates weekly, FAO fishing data monthly. Our pipeline automates downloads and processing. For real-time decisions, we use the most recent available data with clear timestamps displayed to users."

**Q: "What about data validation and accuracy?"**
**A:** "All data comes from authoritative sources: Copernicus Marine Service (EU-funded, peer-reviewed), FAO (UN agency), and Protected Planet (IUCN-verified). We apply quality control checks during processing and flag any anomalies."

**Q: "Can this scale beyond the Mediterranean?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. Our architecture is region-agnostic. The same data sources cover global oceans. We focused on the Mediterranean because it has the highest overfishing rate, but the platform can expand to any marine region."

---

#### **Business Questions:**

**Q: "Who are your primary customers?"**
**A:** "Three tiers: (1) National fisheries management agencies—our anchor customers, (2) Aquaculture companies for site selection, (3) Conservation NGOs for MPA planning. Each has distinct needs and budgets."

**Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
**A:** "We start with pilot partnerships with 2-3 Mediterranean governments, using their validation to build credibility. Then scale to commercial users. We're pursuing EDITO platform integration for built-in distribution."

**Q: "How do you compare to existing fisheries management tools?"**
**A:** "Traditional tools are single-species focused and report-based. We're ecosystem-based and interactive. The closest competitor is EcoSpace, but it's academic software, not a user-friendly platform. We're the first commercial-grade, real-time, stakeholder-focused solution."

---

#### **Impact Questions:**

**Q: "How do you measure success?"**
**A:** "Three metrics: (1) Reduction in overfishing pressure in areas where MedGuard is used—tracked via FAO data, (2) Increase in effective MPA coverage—measured through Protected Planet, (3) User adoption—number of fisheries managers and farmers using the platform."

**Q: "What's your evidence that ecosystem-based management works?"**
**A:** "Multiple peer-reviewed studies show ecosystem-based approaches reduce stock collapse rates by 40-60% compared to single-species management. Norway, Iceland, and New Zealand have successfully implemented similar frameworks. The science is proven—the missing piece is accessible tools."

**Q: "How does this address climate change?"**
**A:** "Climate change shifts fish distributions and habitat quality. Our platform incorporates ocean temperature and other climate indicators, allowing managers to adapt strategies as conditions change. This is dynamic management, not static rules."

---

#### **EDITO-Specific Questions:**

**Q: "How does MedGuard utilize EDITO infrastructure specifically?"**
**A:** "We use EDITO's cloud computing for processing large NetCDF files, their data lake for Copernicus access, and we're exploring workflow managers for automated updates. The platform is built to integrate with EDITO's service ecosystem."

**Q: "What makes this a good fit for EDITO Model Lab?"**
**A:** "EDITO's mission is making ocean data accessible and actionable. MedGuard embodies this—we take complex oceanographic data and transform it into decisions that protect marine ecosystems. We're a showcase application for EDITO's vision."
