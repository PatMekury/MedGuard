**Mitigation:** Multi-source redundancy, local data caching, formal data agreements

**Risk:** Platform performance issues with large datasets
**Mitigation:** Invest in optimization, leverage EDITO's scalable infrastructure

### Regulatory Risks

**Risk:** Changes in Mediterranean fishing policy
**Mitigation:** Policy changes create MORE demand for our decision tools

**Risk:** Data privacy/sovereignty concerns
**Mitigation:** Deploy regional instances, comply with GDPR, offer on-premise options

### Competition Risks
